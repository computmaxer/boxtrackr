boxtrackr
============
This is code for a webap project called BoxTrackr that allows easy managing of tracking numbers for shipments.

The idea was to simply allow a user to forward an email with a tracking number, and it would be added to their BoxTrackr account.

After starting this project (http://www.boxtrackr.com/) with [mpdavis](http://www.github.com/mpdavis), we discovered that this already exists, [fara](http://www.faranow.com/)

We have open-sourced the code, hopefully the examples of how to interact with the shipping APIs can be useful for someone.
